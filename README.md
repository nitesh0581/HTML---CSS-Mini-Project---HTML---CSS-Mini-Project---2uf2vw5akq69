b. HOW did you make the project (Tech Stack, Database, APIs)?

I made this project using two technical languages: HTML & CSS. 
-> HTML: 

Hypertext Markup Language or html is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.

-> CSS:

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

c. WHAT features, technical things you had implemented?

The main technical features in my project:

1. I made it Responsive as much i can using HTML & CSS.

2. Well categorized sections for user friendlyness.

3. All the nav text like About, tags,contacts are properly linked with their respected sections just to create ease of navigation for users.
